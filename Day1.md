## Exploitation Research

initial access - first way into a system 
  - most common method for gaining initial access?
    - phishing, spear phishing is more targeted and specific phishing
  - other techniques:
    - default credentials, stolen credentials, password spraying, password/credential reuse, watering hole attacks
    targets of opportunity, public service exploitation, webserver exploitation, network binary exploitation
    
Learn to pair vulnerabilities to exploits
  - not every vulnerabilities will actually be exploitable

### Research
- confidential/Top Secret research isnt always better than open source research
  - *Intelligence* is processed information, *Information* is just collected info 

### Testing
- Test and verify for success
  - testing provides a number of benefits:
    - faster time to breakout of initial foothold
    - reduce risk of detection and tool failure
    - improved recovery times
